# Changes summary

> not this fork's Mia TR3 + transplant serve. That serve is [`MIA-512K.md`](MIA-512K.md).

> **Work in progress.** Every number below comes from one pair of DGX Sparks and the abliterated checkpoint
> `neko-legends/GLM-5.3-Flash-Uncensored-EXL3`, over three days (2026-09-27 to 2026-09-29). Statuses and defaults may
> change. What changed since the initial public release: [Update 2026-09-29](#update-2026-09-29-patches-0230-0410-test-windows-w1-w10).

Every engine change is a patch against TensorFold `2f8e514` (0.3.4), applied at image build, with a `GLM53_TF_*` knob
that defaults to upstream behaviour. Details, knobs and exactness arguments: [`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md). Raw numbers:
[`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) and `results/`.

**Gain** column: *measured* = an A/B on the real model on this pair (source run in brackets); *estimate* = from
kernel timings, a microbenchmark or arithmetic, not an end-to-end A/B. **Status**: *on* = set in both production
configs (`config/prod*.env.example`); *batch* = on in the batch configs (production and 4 x 256k) only; *single* = single-stream config only;
*opt-in* = off unless you set it; *rejected* = tried, measured, left off; *superseded* / *tool* as noted.

## Update 2026-09-29 (patches 0230-0410, test windows W1-W10)

Since the initial public release (patches 0001-0220, the 4 x 256k batch config), 20 patches were added (0230-0410,
57 in total) and ten GPU test windows run (W1-W10, `docs/RESULTS.md`; scripts and JSON in `results/W1`-`W10`). The
production config (`config/prod.env.example`) is now 4 concurrent requests over one shared 1,048,576-token FP8 KV
pool. Its headline numbers (W10): prefill ~1,607 tok/s at 24.5k and ~1,600 at 98k (was 1,154 / 1,127; the vLLM kit:
1,448 at 28k), single-stream decode 1.20-1.96x the vLLM kit on every cell (tf code greedy 77.6, kit structured 100.6),
~78 tok/s aggregate at 4 streams, restart in 22-23 s, exact 10/10, batchexact 4/4, MMLU-200 88.0%, refusals 0/10.

Adopted (on in `config/prod.env.example`):

| Patch | What | Gain (measured) | Window |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0190 update | `attn_bm32` (32-query latent tiles) + `GLM53_TF_MTP_PREFILL_CACHE=1` (the MTP head's prefill rows as cache writes only) | +11% prefill at 24.5k / 98k, same bits | W1 |
| 0250 `glm-session-nvme` | the session store's NVMe tier (`GLM53_TF_SESSION_DISK`): per-rank shards, SHA-256 per chunk, write-through, restart indexing | a 39k session back in 0.42-0.45 s instead of 31 s, also after a restart | W4 |
| 0290 `glm-kv-pool` | one paged latent KV pool shared by the 4 slots (`GLM53_TF_KV_POOL_TOKENS`); admission reserves pages, spills idle slots, or waits | 1M context a request (was 262k) at the same memory; prefill -0.5 to -2% | W6 |
| 0300 `glm-request-log` | one JSON line a request, no text (`GLM53_TF_REQUEST_LOG`); `scripts/traffic-report.py` | tool; no speed change | W8 |
| 0310 `glm-prefix-share` | snapshots at the end of the system prompt; new sessions resume there (`GLM53_TF_PREFIX_SHARE`) | 4-session burst over ~18k system prompt 28.2 s instead of 72.4 s; 2nd session TTFT 2.24 vs 3.25 s | W8 |
| 0320 `glm-prefill-row-split` | each rank runs the hyper-connections on half the rows (`GLM53_TF_PREFILL_PP`) | +7.3-8.1% prefill, same bits | W8 |
| 0335 `glm-solo-piece` | a lone request prefills in larger pieces (`GLM53_TF_SOLO_PIECE`) | +3-4% at 4,096 rows (+6% at 8,192, rejected for memory in W9) | W8, W9 |
| 0230 + 0350 `glm-roce-gather`, `glm-roce-loopback-fix` | one-shot RoCE all-gather ported from b12x (Apache-2.0), up to 256 KiB, NCCL fallback + failure marker (`GLM53_TF_COMM_BACKEND=roce`); 0350 explained W2's loopback failure (the harness) | decode +10.8% (1 stream) / +4.3% (4 streams) median, transcripts byte-identical | W9 |
| 0360 `glm-b12x-attn-fp8` | b12x bit 4 (one-pass sparse latent attention) fit for FP8 KV and sessions (`GLM53_TF_B12X=4`) | +6.3% / +6.7% prefill, same reply hashes | W9 |
| 0390 `glm-mla-expand-v2` | latent absorb / expand retiled, same bits (`GLM53_TF_MLA_EXPAND=v2`) | +7.1% / +6.7% prefill | W10 |
| 0370 `glm-decode-overlap-cpu-pin` | decode-round host work off the critical path (`GLM53_TF_DECODE_OVERLAP=1`) | decode +1.3-1.9% (1 stream), +1-3% (4 streams), transcripts identical | W10 |
| 0380 `glm-deep-verify` | verify windows of up to 16 rows (`GLM53_TF_MAX_DRAFT_ROWS=16`) | edit cells +16-27%, every other cell within +-2%, all reply hashes identical | W10 |

Measured and not adopted (the patches stay in the series, off by default):

| Patch | Result | Window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0240 `glm-b12x-prefill` bits 1-2 (b12x KDA, fused mhc) | KDA 0.94x, fused mhc 0.69-0.74x of today's kernels; only bit 4 helps (adopted via 0360) | W3 |
| 0260 `glm-expert-decode-once` | never beats `fat` (0.89-1.01x) | W2 |
| 0270 `glm-fast-experts-auto` | -2% end to end although fast2 wins the isolated kernel at <= 2,048 rows | W5 |
| 0280 `glm-batch-buckets` | 80-91% graph replays but -5% aggregate at 4 streams (padded rows cost ~1 ms each) | W5 |
| 0330 `glm-expert-tc` | cfg 1/2 cannot launch on GB10 (registers); cfg 3 -4% end to end | W8 |
| 0340 `glm-batch-adapt` | offline simulator: per-slot drafter choice -0.4%, serial rounds for weak slots -6.5%; not run on GPU end to end | offline, W9 (per-slot cost measured) |
| 0370 `GLM53_TF_CPU_PIN` | +0.4% | W10 |
| 0400 `glm-kda-v2` | split +1.0-1.2% (bar +2%); fused slower than today | W10 |
| 0410 `glm-sparse-v2` | +0% end to end (kernel 0.82x) | W10 |
| 8,192-row lone chunks | +~4% prefill, but the 4 x 250k stress minimum fell to 7.23 GiB on the worker (target >= 8) | W9, W10 |

Measurement-only work: `docs/PROFILE.md` (W7 nsys profile of prefill and decode), `docs/ROOFLINE.md` (first-principles
roofline and ranked gaps), `docs/RESEARCH-NIGHT.md` and `docs/PARADIGMS.md` (surveys), `docs/DECODE-PLAN.md` (a sourced plan toward +40% decode, not yet run), `docs/DEEP-VERIFY.md` /
`docs/ADAPTIVE-DRAFT.md` (draft simulators: `bench/draftsim.py`, `bench/lookupsim.py`), design notes `docs/KV-POOL.md`,
`PREFIX-SHARE.md`, `PREFILL-PP.md`, `EXPERT-TC.md`, `DECODE-OVERLAP.md`, `MLA-EXPAND.md`, `KDA-V2.md`, `SPARSE-V2.md`,
`ROCE-FIX.md`.

Launcher and ops: `scripts/gpuwatch.py` (GB10 clock / power-clamp / slow-state watch; `serve.sh gpucheck`, a
preflight gate, systemd units, `docs/OPS-GPUWATCH.md`), `scripts/traffic-report.py`, `serve.sh` mounts the NVMe
session tier (`HEAD_SESSIONS` / `WORKER_SESSIONS`) and takes `CPUSET`; the Dockerfile installs libibverbs if a base
image lacks it (0230). Memory notes: the worker node binds; a 314k needle right after the stress and MMLU dipped to
7.39 GiB MemAvailable on it (no OOM), recorded as an open end in `docs/RESULTS.md` W10.

## Rejected or left off, with the reason

| Patch / knob | Result | Why off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0083 FP8 prefill (`fp8_prefill`) | +7-11% prefill (28k 1,062 -> 1,177; 112k 1,105 -> 1,186) | greedy replies diverged from bf16 prefill within ~20 tokens on 25 of 30 prompts; a behaviour change for a single-digit gain |
| 0130 decode-step kernels (`DECODE_KERNELS=v2[,pdl]`) | slower on the real model: 1-row verify 31.8 -> 32.7 / 32.9 ms; tf code greedy 64.3 -> 62.4 / 56.4 tok/s | regression |
| 0190 `hc_fused` | bit-exact but 7-8x slower on GB10 (num_stages=1 to fit shared memory) | slower |
| 0190 `moe_glue=7` (one-kernel router) | 1,218 / 1,229 vs 1,266 / 1,238 for `moe_glue=5` | slower at 8192 rows |
| 0190 `attn_bm32` + `mtp_window` | up to 1,389 / 1,357 tok/s at 28k / 112k (+10%), exact 10/10 | rank 0 ran out of unified memory at 524k context + 12 GiB store; `mtp_window` cut decode after a 112k prompt 81 -> 56 tok/s. **Update (W1)**: `attn_bm32` is on in the batch / production configs (+5% prefill, memory unchanged); `mtp_window` stays off |
| 0190 `LATENT_TC` | bf16 tensor-core absorb / expand | changes replies |
| 0170 BF16 KDA projection copy | 1.45x on that matmul | +3.26 GiB a rank; unaffordable with the session store at 524k |
| Single-stream `SESSION_GIB=12` at 524k | worked for hours | the store filled under agent traffic and the pair died of unified-memory OOM; examples use 6 (single) / 2 (batch) |

## Launcher and operations changes (not engine patches)

| Change | What | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/serve.sh` | build here and ship the image to the worker; start rank 1 then rank 0; wait for `/v1/models`; refuse while another CUDA process runs on either node; caller env overrides the config | on |
| post-load canary (`scripts/canary.py`) | 3 greedy probes: degenerate output or a dead drafter (tokens a round < 1.3) fail the start in `strict` | on (`warn`) |
| warm-up (`WARMUP_LENGTHS`) | prefills ~4k and ~16k prompts after load so the first real prompt does not compile kernels (first 7k prefill: 727 tok/s cold) | on |
| memory gate (`MEM_GATE_*`) | waits for MemFree on both nodes (drops page caches) before launch; needed for the 4th batch slot | batch |
| preflight, start lock, Xid scan, log rotation | config / ssh / image / RDMA / sysctl parity checks; one start at a time; NVIDIA Xid events on both nodes | opt-in |
| watchdog (`serve.sh watch`, systemd user units) | restarts both ranks after repeated `/health` failures; `KillMode=process` so the detached restart survives the oneshot unit (found in a heal test) | installed in production |
| `scripts/prepare.sh` | writes the prepared weight folders (0140) on both nodes in parallel | tool |
| entrypoint | removes stale torch-extension locks after an OOM-killed start (a start once waited 24 min on one) | on |
| kernel cache volume | torch extensions, Triton and the CUDA JIT cache persist across restarts | on |
| `docker/compose.yaml` | the same container per node via Docker Compose | alternative |
| config placeholder guard | `serve.sh` / `prepare.sh` refuse a config that still contains `<placeholders>` | on |
| production config by default | `serve.sh` / `prepare.sh` read `config/prod.env` unless `CONFIG` is set and point at `config/prod.env.example` when it is missing; the 32k template is `config/minimal.env.example` (debugging baseline); `AGENTS.md` walks an AI coding agent through setup | on |
| context visibility | `serve.sh start` logs the `CONTEXT` it will serve, warns on a short or unset `CONTEXT`, refuses `CONTEXT` > 131,072 on the per-head KV cache (`FORCE_CONTEXT=1` overrides), and logs the context once ready (docs/TRYING.md section 10) | on |
| preflight checks | `serve.sh preflight` also checks docker, the CX7 netdev address and `HEAD_IP`, the weights / drafter snapshots, MemFree, `sudo -n`, CUDA processes and the RoCE failure marker on both nodes, with the fix in each message | on |
| `scripts/check-public.sh` | scans the tree for private IPs, hostnames, keys and tokens before publishing | tool |
| benchmarks (`bench/`) | `glmbench.py` (decode / prefill / exactness), `multiturn.py` (sessions, follow-ups, concurrency, stall, slots, memory stress), `quality.py` (MMLU-200 + refusals), `toolcall_harness.py`, `fp8ab.py` (reply agreement / needle A/B) | tool |
